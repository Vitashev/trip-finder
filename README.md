# E-Commerce Frontend technical assignment

## About the project

First of all thank you for considering working with KPN. We admire your efforts and respect your time, therefore we ask you to please carefully read the project description and only work on stuff that is listed among the objectives.
The overall goal of the assignment is to create a minimal implementation of our online shopping flow.

## Our shopping workflow and terminology

- You land on a page where all of the available services/products are displayed - **catalogue view**.
- You choose a service/product and get sent to another page which contains a detailed information about the product - **product description view**.
- After revising everything about the service/product you confirm that you would like to purchase/subscribe to it. You can do this by clicking a "Purchase" button.
- You get redirected to a page where you have to fill in forms with personal details - **checkout view**.
- After you fill in all of your details you finally click "Submit Order" and get redirected to the **confirmation view** where you can see the details of your order.

Pretty standard huh?

If you are interested or just need inspiration head over to the [Mobile Products Shop](https://www.kpn.com/mobiel/) or [Residential Products Shop](https://www.kpn.com/internet-tv/) to see and interact with two of our current implementations.

## Goals
### What we would ideally like to see
- Create a [catalogue view](https://s18.postimg.org/wxd2fumzd/Catalogue.png) where all the products are displayed (json with the list of products are provided).
- Create a [product description view](https://s18.postimg.org/apdoggiqh/Product_description_view_1.png) where full information of the selected product is displayed.
- Create a [checkout view](https://s18.postimg.org/k78u2rf15/Checkout.png) where the selected product is displayed along with a form that has the following input fields
    - First name
    - Last name
    - Date of birth
    - E-mail
    - Preferred delivery date
- Create a [confirmation view](https://s12.postimg.org/fry83aadp/Confirmation.png) where the customer and product details are displayed
- Mock implementation of backend calls
- Very basic layout and styling
- Basic validations
- Flow state persistence

## Technology stack

Although we use Angular 5 with Typescript and Vue.js for different applications, we put no restrictions on the languages, frameworks, tools and libraries you wish to use so long they support the purpose.
The code must be fully executable on our end.

## Time and Deadline

Please do not spend much more than 8 hours of development on the project. If you are not completely done it is not a problem, quality over quantity is the motto.

## Disclaimer

This programming challenge is one step in a multiple step hiring process. It is a means to assess the competency of our candidates.
The work you will do - including writing code and/or designing software - is NOT going to be reused, copied or in any form replicated by us or any of our third parties.
